# A-Fine-Windy-Day

The repository contains the modularized code for a Machine Learning Challange held at HackerEarth namely A Fine Windy Day. The challenge was to predict the amount of power generated from windmills given various features like windmill height, blades length, etc. Challenge link: https://www.hackerearth.com/problem/machine-learning/predict-the-power-kwh-produced-from-the-windmills-8-f055f832/

The metrics used for evaluation of the challenge was R2 score and score of the final model I trained was 96.88662. My rank was 35 out of 2124 participants. Leaderboard link: https://www.hackerearth.com/challenges/competitive/hackerearth-machine-learning-challenge-predict-windmill-power/leaderboard

Notebook contains all the techniques performed like Data Cleaning, Exploratory Data Analysis, Feature Engineering, Model training and evaluation, and hyperparameter tuning in rough manner. 
Src folder contains python scripts in a modularized way with description as commit message.
Input folder contains raw and processed data.
